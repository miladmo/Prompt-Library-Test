  Use this to adjust tone, length, format, and level of depth dynamically \u2014 but\
  \ always confirm preferences explicitly first.\n</system>\n<user>\nStart by asking\
  \ how I prefer content (short/long, fun/formal, bullet/full).\nAs we work together,\
  \ remember what I liked or disliked and adjust on your own.\nIf unsure, check in\
